# Mobius Strip Modeler

This Python script models a Mobius strip using parametric equations, computes key geometric properties (surface area and edge length), and visualizes the strip in 3D.

## Features

*   Defines a `MobiusStrip` class for easy instantiation and manipulation.
*   Accepts radius (`R`), width (`w`), and resolution (`n`) as input parameters.
*   Generates a 3D mesh of (x, y, z) points on the surface.
*   Numerically approximates the surface area by summing triangular patch areas.
*   Numerically approximates the length of the single continuous edge.
*   Visualizes the 3D Mobius strip using Matplotlib, with an option to highlight the edge.
*   Saves the visualization to a file (`mobius_strip_visualization.png`).

## Parametric Equations Used

The script uses the following standard parametric equations for a Mobius strip:

*   `x(u,v) = (R + v * cos(u/2)) * cos(u)`
*   `y(u,v) = (R + v * cos(u/2)) * sin(u)`
*   `z(u,v) = v * sin(u/2)`

Where:
*   `u` ∈ `[0, 2π]` (angle around the main loop)
*   `v` ∈ `[-w/2, w/2]` (distance from the center line, across the width)
*   `R` is the radius of the center loop of the strip.
*   `w` is the width of the strip.

## Requirements

*   Python 3.x
*   NumPy: `pip install numpy`
*   Matplotlib: `pip install matplotlib`

## How to Run

1.  Save the Python code as `mobius_strip_model.py`.
2.  Run the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python mobius_strip_model.py
    ```
3.  The script will:
    *   Print the calculated surface area and edge length to the console.
    *   Display a 3D plot of the Mobius strip.
    *   Save the plot as `mobius_strip_visualization.png` in the same directory.

You can modify the parameters `R_center`, `strip_width`, and `resolution` within the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block in the script to generate different Mobius strips.

## Code Structure

The Python script `mobius_strip_model.py` is structured around a `MobiusStrip` class:

*   **`__init__(self, R, w, n)`**:
    *   Initializes the strip with `R` (radius), `w` (width), and `n` (resolution).
    *   Derives `self.n_u` (points along length, U-direction) and `self.n_v` (points across width, V-direction) from `n`.
    *   Calls `_generate_mesh()` to create surface points.

*   **`_parametric_eq(self, u, v)`**:
    *   Implements the parametric equations for x, y, z coordinates.

*   **`_generate_mesh(self)`**:
    *   Generates 1D arrays for `u` and `v` domains.
    *   Uses `np.meshgrid` to create 2D `U_grid` and `V_grid`.
    *   Computes `self.X`, `self.Y`, `self.Z` coordinate matrices.

*   **`mesh_points_stacked` (property)**:
    *   Returns mesh points as an `(N_points, 3)` array.

*   **`compute_surface_area(self)`**:
    *   Numerically approximates surface area by summing the areas of small triangular patches. Each quadrilateral formed by the grid is split into two triangles. The area of each triangle is `0.5 * ||AB x AC||`.

*   **`compute_edge_length(self)`**:
    *   Numerically approximates the length of the single continuous edge by summing Euclidean distances between consecutive points along the strip's boundaries (`v = -w/2` and `v = w/2`), including the connections that demonstrate its single-edge nature.

*   **`plot(self, ax=None, show_edges=True, save_path=None)`**:
    *   Visualizes the Mobius strip using `matplotlib.pyplot`. Uses `ax.plot_surface()` for the mesh and optionally plots the edge path.

*   **Main script block (`if __name__ == "__main__":`)**:
    *   Demonstrates class usage: creates an instance, computes properties, prints results, and generates a plot.

## Surface Area Approximation

The surface area is approximated by:
1.  Discretizing the surface into a mesh of small quadrilateral patches based on the `(u,v)` grid.
2.  Dividing each quadrilateral patch into two triangles.
3.  Calculating the area of each triangle using the vector cross product method: `Area = 0.5 * ||(P2 - P1) x (P3 - P1)||`.
4.  Summing the areas of all these small triangles.

The accuracy of this approximation increases with higher mesh resolution (larger `n`).

## Challenges Faced

*   **Single Edge Representation**: Correctly tracing and calculating the length of the Mobius strip's single continuous edge was a key challenge. This involved understanding how the parameterization's "top" edge (`v = w/2` at `u = 2π`) connects to the "bottom" edge (`v = -w/2` at `u = 0`) due to the half-twist.
*   **`meshgrid` Indexing**: Ensuring correct array shapes and indexing from `np.meshgrid` (using `indexing='xy'`) for calculations and plotting required careful attention.
*   **Resolution Parameter `n`**: Interpreting `n` as the primary resolution for the `u`-direction and deriving a sensible `n_v` (width resolution) was an implementation detail. `n_v` was chosen as `max(3, n_u/10)` to ensure enough points for mesh generation.
*   **3D Visualization**: Fine-tuning Matplotlib 3D plots for clarity, aspect ratio, and accurate representation can be iterative.
